# Micropython_Pico_DRV8825
A small program to run a NEMA 14 stepper motor with a Raspberry Pi Pico using a DRV8825 and micropython. I am not a programmer so it just was the best I was able to do because I could not find something written in micropython for the pico.
This is a easy way to drive a stepper by full steps. The Nema 11 motor has 200 steps per turn so for my project this was precise enough.
